## Topics Discussed

Trying to log in to the API access
- Did not work for anyone, we will ask Alex about that

Also ask them about the database hosting
- What sort of information should be contained in the database for this project? 
- Should the users be able to make changes to the Database through the Calculation Webpage? 
- How will the database be hosted?

Looking through the API Documentation
- https://dev-totalapi.moneytree.com/swagger/index.html?url=/swagger/v1/swagger.json# 
- Models looks like database stuff
- Everything we need should be there

Programming language
- Probably best to use C# for this project from the .NET sphere

IDE use
- Probably use VSCode


## Things Clarified

Send out that email about the API access and database

Once we get access we can start fudging around with the API and getting things rolling
- Everyone can do some exploring into how the API works and what we would need to do to implement it
