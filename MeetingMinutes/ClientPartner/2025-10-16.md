## Topics Discussed

Alex went over the demo website
- Need retirement age and life expectancy to determine length
- Default rates for taxes
- Liabilities
- Cash Flow allocation; where money that is coming in will go in terms of investments
- Update asset window
- Be able to target individual members of accounts
- Roth conversion inputting
- Salary wages, social security, pensions, other income need to be defined and included based on taxable/untaxable basis
- Personal expense information, other expenses, insurance, and financial goals specified
- Tax filing status; system defaults should cover this

Things we need to capture for calculation
- Retirement age
- Life expectancy
- Default rates
- 401k, IRA, other assets and their rates of return
- One balance for each type (taxed or not)
- Income (Can approximate social security)
- Include pensions in further versions
- Total annual budget/expenses
- Tax information
- State selection dropdown

He also went over the analysis charts for us to understand their designs to moreso match their style
- Net worth
- Cash Flow
- What if tool (useful for comparison of specific parameters)
- Some sort of summary
- Goal evaluation (turning some assumptions on/off to see impacts)
- Retirement requirements in order to fulfill plans
- How on-track they are for that


## Things Clarified

We now have a more solid idea of how to approach development
- What things should look like
- What specifically we need to include for early and even some later iteration inclusions

AI Notes will be sent to us if we need to go over the demo site again at a later point
