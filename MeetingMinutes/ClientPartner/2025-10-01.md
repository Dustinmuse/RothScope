## Topics Discussed

Questions we asked for clarification:

API Documentation access?
- We can get that from Alex
- dev-totalapi.moneytree.com (Check out this link for info)
- After all NDAs signed we get full access to things

Database Structure
- What we are pulling from Moneytree’s, what needs to be in ours
- Noah will email Alex and Evan directly since he was having trouble with wording during the meeting

Evan’s role
- Vague technical mentor for the project
- Alex is the product lead


Design materials created:
- Business Requirements
- Use Cases
- Requirements
- Domain Model
- Architecture
- TechStack
- Prototype
- First Iteration Features

Feedback for each:

Business Requirements
- Might change a bit as the project moves forward, good for now.

Use Cases
- No notes

Requirements
- Look good, also a solid prioritization in the order they are in on the presentation

Domain Model
- Maximize overall assets, not strictly after-tax
- Otherwise looks good

Architecture
- Will share with Evan to verify

TechStack
- No notes, that is what they requested

Prototype
- No notes from a high-level perspective, may need to add/remove certain variables, export features, etc depending on need

First Iteration Features
- No notes


## Things Clarified

Alex will reach out to Evan for his input on the design elements, mainly Architecture and Domain Model
- Things may change with his feedback

After the design presentation we will focus on getting started on exploring the API, database, and begin coding
