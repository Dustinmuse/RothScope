# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### Group 1: User Input and Data Collection
- **FR1 (HIGH, UC1):** The system shall allow the user to enter basic client financial parameters, including retirement age, life expectancy, current income sources, and annual expenses.  
- **FR2 (HIGH, UC1):** The system shall allow the user to enter current asset balances across qualified and non-qualified accounts.  
- **FR3 (HIGH, UC2):** The system shall allow the user to enter expected performance rates on assets.  

### Group 2: Tax Calculation
- **FR4 (HIGH, UC3):** The system shall perform a baseline “as-is” tax calculation using provided client parameters.  
- **FR5 (HIGH, UC3):** The system shall display the results of the baseline tax calculation to the user in a clear and understandable format.  

### Group 3: Roth Conversion Parameters
- **FR6 (HIGH, UC4):** The system shall allow the user to define Roth conversion objectives (e.g., minimize cumulative taxes, maximize ending total assets).  
- **FR7 (MEDIUM, UC4):** The system shall allow the user to enter a target start age and conversion period length.  
- **FR8 (HIGH, UC4):** The system shall store Roth conversion parameters for use in optimization calculations.  

### Group 4: Optimization and Analysis
- **FR9 (HIGH, UC5):** The system shall run multiple Roth conversion scenarios by varying timing and amount until the optimal result is found.  
- **FR10 (HIGH, UC5):** The system shall determine the optimal Roth conversion strategy according to user-defined objectives.  
- **FR11 (MEDIUM, UC5):** The system shall allow the user to compare the optimal strategy with alternative strategies.

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance
- **NR1 (HIGH, UC5):** The system shall compute and return optimization results within 10 seconds for typical client datasets.  

### Security
- **NR2 (HIGH, UC1–UC5):** The system shall encrypt sensitive financial data both in transit (TLS 1.2 or higher) and at rest.  
- **NR3 (HIGH, UC1–UC5):** The system shall enforce role-based access control to restrict sensitive financial information.  

### Usability
- **NR4 (HIGH, UC1–UC5):** The system shall present all input forms and outputs in a clear, user-friendly interface with error validation.  

### Reliability & Availability
- **NR6 (HIGH, UC1–UC5):** The system shall maintain 99.5% uptime during business hours (Mon–Fri, 8 AM–6 PM EST).  
- **NR7 (HIGH, UC5):** The system shall automatically save user progress every 2 minutes to prevent data loss.  

### Compatibility
- **NR8 (MEDIUM, UC1–UC5):** The system shall be compatible with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers.  

### Maintainability
- **NR10 (MEDIUM, UC1–UC5):** The system shall be implemented using modular architecture to facilitate future enhancements.  
- **NR11 (MEDIUM, UC1–UC5):** The system shall include automated unit and integration tests covering at least 80% of the codebase.
