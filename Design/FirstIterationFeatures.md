# Iteration 1 – Features
## Functional Requirements (FR)

- **FR1 (HIGH, UC1):** The system shall allow the user to enter basic client financial parameters (retirement age, life expectancy, current income, annual expenses).  
- **FR2 (HIGH, UC1):** The system shall allow the user to enter current asset balances across qualified and non-qualified accounts.  
- **FR3 (HIGH, UC2):** The system shall allow the user to enter expected performance rates on assets.  
- **FR4 (HIGH, UC3):** The system shall perform a baseline “as-is” tax calculation using provided client parameters.  
- **FR5 (HIGH, UC3):** The system shall display the results of the baseline tax calculation to the user in a clear format.  

## Non-functional Requirements (NR)

- **NR2 (HIGH, UC1–UC6):** The system shall encrypt sensitive financial data both in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest.  
- **NR4 (HIGH, UC1–UC6):** The system shall present all input forms and outputs in a clear, user-friendly interface with error validation.

## Justification
The above requirements were chosen because they provide a **functional software foundation** for Iteration 1:
- Users can **enter financial data**.  
- The system can **run a baseline calculation**.  
- The system can **display meaningful results** securely and clearly.  

This ensures the project delivers immediate value and creates the base for later iterations (Roth conversion optimization, reporting/export features, etc.).

## Project Management Setup
Cards for each of the above requirements should be created in the **To Do** column of the GitHub Project board.
