## BR1 Optimal Roth Conversion Tool

Moneytree, as a financial advising application, has many useful tools for financial planning. However, they do not currently have a tool that calculates the optimal time and/or amount to convert tax-deferred retirement
account funds into a Roth account. The goal is to use variables such as income, yearly spending, and retirement age alongside the Moneytree calculation engine to create a model that maximizes total ending assets and/or minimizes cumulative taxes. This tool can then be used to formulate future financial strategies for users of Moneytree. A database will also be associated with this tool that allows for easy retrieval of client data and storage of outcomes for future planning. Having this tool implemented into software would expand Moneytree's market space and usefulness to clients who use their platform.
