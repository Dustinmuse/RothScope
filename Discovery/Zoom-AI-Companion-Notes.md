## Quick recap

The team discussed a project to optimize Roth conversions, focusing on balancing tax payments and investment potential while developing a web application for financial advisors. They explored technical requirements including API integration, data input methods, and authentication requirements for the application. The team agreed to prioritize creating a functional proof of concept that utilizes existing resources and databases, with plans to meet regularly and continue discussions via email.

## Next steps

- Alex to check how much access the team will have to Moneytree's database
- Alex to inquire about the budget for the project with Dan
- Team to develop an optimization model for determining optimal Roth conversion timing
- Team to implement PDF reporting functionality for the application
- Team to set up Jira to help track work progress
- Alex to schedule bi-weekly meetings with the team
- Team to focus first on minimizing cumulative taxes for the optimization feature
- Team to decide between Microsoft SQL Server and Postgres for the database

## Summary

### Roth Conversion Optimization Project

The team discussed a project to optimize Roth conversions, which involves calculating various options based on an investor's tax and capital needs. Alex explained that the project will focus on balancing tax payments and investment potential, considering the differences between Roth (after-tax) and traditional (pre-tax) accounts. They agreed to meet monthly and potentially set up bi-weekly sessions, with Alex suggesting the use of Jira for tracking progress. Noah inquired about how Moneytree previously handled simpler Roth calculations, to which Alex responded by describing the current process of allowing users to specify balance, start age, duration, and conversion method (flat dollar or percentage).

### Financial Advisor Web App Development

The team discussed developing a web application for financial advisors, with Alex confirming it would primarily target financial advisors but could potentially be used by their clients and integrated with other financial tools. Noah inquired about various technical aspects, including API integration with Moneytree's calculation engine, two-factor authentication requirements, and data input methods, with Alex clarifying that the application would be desktop-focused initially and that two-factor authentication would be optional.

### Roth Conversion Optimization Tool Requirements

The team discussed requirements for a Roth conversion optimization tool to be built within Moneytree's existing software. Alex explained that the tool would need to handle both automatic database pulls and manual input of data, with the ability to optimize conversions based on client-specified variables. The team agreed to prioritize minimizing cumulative taxes in the optimization model, with the initial focus on creating a functional proof of concept rather than a polished interface. The project will utilize existing resources and databases, with PDF reporting capabilities and potential for both digital and printed outputs across multiple pages.

### Morning Meetings and Schedule Coordination

The team concluded their meeting with Alex, who offered to address any further questions via email. Alex mentioned that he would be more available for morning meetings in the future, noting that the current meeting time was challenging due to time zone differences. Gabe acknowledged the difficulty in aligning schedules for the group. The conversation ended with expressions of gratitude and goodbyes.
